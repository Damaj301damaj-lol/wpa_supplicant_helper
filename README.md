# wpa_supplicant_helper
An in-the-making script to help you setup wpa_supplicant!
**THIS SCRIPT IS IN BETA AND DOES NOT WORK**
Pull Requests And Issue Reporting are appreciated

## Goals
- Actually Making this script work
- Making this script fully POSIX complaint
- Save Connections for use in the future
- Small dmenu script that resets wpa_supplicant and disables it
- And more!


NOTE: i am an amateur script programmer and my script is probably NOT the most light/best working script, this is a small hobby project!
